# Automated Bulk Message Sender for Hotel Guests

*This project was created for real hotel needs during an unexpected rainy day. Sometimes the best ideas come from challenging moments!*

A personal and highly practical automation for hotel operations. This script quickly sends a single custom message (e.g. feedback, check-in/out confirmation) to a list of guest phone numbers, solving a repetitive front desk task with just one click.

## Project Overview

- Problem solved: Manual WhatsApp notification of many guests at checkout or for campaigns is slow, boring, and prone to errors — especially with large volumes after events or at busy times.
- With an easy-to-use Tkinter GUI, staff can paste or upload a batch of phone numbers, set the message, and let the tool     handle sending, maintaining a 15-second interval between each message to avoid WhatsApp automation blocks.
- Useful for sending checkout welcome messages, reminders, arrival details, or mass feedback requests while protecting your WhatsApp account.

## Technologies

- Python (Tkinter for GUI)
- WhatsApp messaging via manual-like automation (e.g. TKinter GUI/sendMessage function)
- Timer logic (15 seconds between messages)

## How to use

1. Start the Tkinter app and input your message and phone numbers list.
2. Click “Send” — the app goes through the list, sending each WhatsApp message with a 15-second delay.
3. Appears as manual sending in WhatsApp to avoid blocking.
4. Easily modifiable for new templates or message variations.

## Key Results

- Saves hours of monotony for busy hotel front desk or marketing teams.
- Maintains compliance with WhatsApp anti‑spam rules.
- Friendly, simple GUI that anyone can use — no code required.
